1 Introduction
**************

Depending on what engine is used to output the pdf file, mathematical
characters can be obtained in *TeX either by using a LaTeX macro (e.g.
‘\rightarrow’) or by inserting Unicode characters directly.

   There are times where one is forced to convert a source file from one
strategy to the other.  For example, one might want to avoid using any
LaTeX macro that can be done without by using a Unicode character, but
then, when the document is completed, it needs to be submitted for in a
format that can be compiled by PdfTeX (which cannot deal with such
characters).

   The aim of ‘math-tex-convert’ is to make these moments as painless as
possible, by providing two commands to go from Unicode to Macros and to
Macros to Unicode.

   The only dependency of ‘math-tex-convert’ that is not built in in
Emacs 26.1+ is ‘math-symbol-list’ (available on GNU Elpa
(https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/math-symbol-lists.html)).  This package
provides the predefined Macro-Unicode mappings that are used by default
(this can be overridden as explained in *note Define your own
replacement rules::).

2 Usage
*******

There are just two interactive commands with self-explanatory names:

   • ‘math-tex-convert-to-macro’
   • ‘math-tex-convert-to-unicode’

   These command target the whole available portion of the buffer if
called when the region is not active; otherwise they target only the
region.  If a prefix argument is passed, only strings that are found in
a (La)TeX math environment are targeted for replacement.

   These functions mimic other built-in commands for text replacement,
like ‘query-replace’.

   The proposed replacement is offered in the echo area.  For example,
given the default mappings, if ‘math-tex-convert-to-unicode’ is called
and we are on ‘\in’ the echo area will show at the left corner ‘\in →
∈.’

   At this point you have different options:

   • ‘n’: skip to the next target
   • ‘SPC’: perform the replacement and move to next target if there is
     one
   • ‘/’: cycle through possible replacements (if there are more than
     one)
   • ‘=’: write in the replacement yourself
   • ‘!’: replace through the rest of the buffer (or region) non
     interactively.

3.1 Define your own replacement rules
=====================================

The predefined replacement rules are taken from the package Math symbol
lists (https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/math-symbol-lists.html) (in GNU
Elpa).

   You can add your rules by changing the value of these two variables
(‘nil’ by default):

   • ‘math-tex-convert-user-defined-macro-to-unicode-map’
   • ‘math-tex-convert-user-defined-unicode-to-macro-map’

   These variables can be either association lists or hash tables,
whichever is more convenient for you (if you have hundreds of rules,
hash tables are recommended).  For the purposes of the exposition here,
let’s assume they are association lists.

   Here’s one possible value:

     (setq math-tex-convert-user-defined-unicode-to-macro-map
           '(("λ" . ("\\lambda" "\\uplambda"))
             ("α" . ("\\alpha"))
             ("→" . nil)))

   Given this value, the string ‘"→"’ will never be considered for
replacement, whereas ‘"λ"’ has to potential replacement through which
you can cycle, the default being ‘"\lambda"’ (the car of the list is the
default).

   User defined rules always override predefined ones that may apply.

   If you want the predefined conversion table provided by Math symbol
lists (https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/math-symbol-lists.html) to be
ignored completely set:

     (setq math-tex-convert-ignore-predefined-tables t)

   Assigning non-nil value to this variable will guarantee that rules
that are not user defined are not operative.

3.2 Strings to be converted only if escaped
===========================================

The default value for ‘math-tex-convert-replace-only-if-escaped’ is the
list:

     '("_" "^" "{" "}")

   These strings will never be targeted for replacement unless they are
escaped according to TeX syntax (i.e., with a backslash).


File: math-tex-convert.info,  Node: Strings never to be replaced,  Prev: Strings to be converted only if escaped,  Up: Modify the defaults

3.3 Strings never to be replaced
================================

The default value for ‘math-tex-convert-strings-never-to-be-replaced’ is
the list:

     '("\\" "(" ")" "$" "[" "]")

   These strings are never replaced.
